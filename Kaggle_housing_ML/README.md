This is all my work for the Kaggle Housing competition - "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" where I used python as my choice of coding language in order to predict housing prices. I received a final score of 0.15235, in which the highest possible is 0. In this competition, I evaluated more than 10 variables and tested different models in order to come up with the best accurate model to predict housing prices. I am proud of the work I did for this competition and would love to dive into more machine learning and data science projects to further explore the possibilites of code.
